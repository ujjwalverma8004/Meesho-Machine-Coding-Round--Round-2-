1st column is Order ID
2nd is location
3rd is events , like vehicle arrive , package unload , quality check , in transit , real time location 
4th is time stamp when these events is ended (date time)


global average time taken for all the actions 
vehicle arrive = 48 hours 
package unload = 5 hours, etc



STep 1 

lets take 
event_duration 
order_id
event
end_timestamp

WITH event_duration AS(
	SELECT 
		order_id,
		event,
		end_timestamp,

//GEt previous event time stamp 
	LAG(end_timestamp) OVER (
		PARTITION BY order_id
		ORDER BY end_timestamp
		) AS prev_timestamp 
	
	FROM logistics_events // main table 
),

duration_diff AS(
	SELECT
		event, 
		TIMESTAMDIFF(SECOND ,
		prev_timestamp, end_timestamp) AS
		duration_in_seconds

	FROM event_duration 
	WHERE prev_timestamp IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT
	event,

SEC_TO_TIME(AVG(duration_in_seconds))
AS average_duration 

FROM duration_diff
GROUP BY event
